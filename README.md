# Clippy ðŸ“Ž

Copy files from your terminal that actually paste into GUI apps. No more switching to Finder.

**macOS only** - built specifically for the Mac clipboard system.

## Why Clippy?

`pbcopy` copies file _contents_, but GUI apps need file _references_. When you `pbcopy < image.png`, you can't paste it into Slack or email - those apps expect files, not raw bytes.

Clippy bridges this gap by detecting what you want and using the right clipboard format:

```bash
# Copy files as references (paste into any GUI app)
clippy report.pdf         # âŒ˜V into Slack/email - uploads the file
clippy *.jpg             # Multiple files at once

# Copy your most recent download
clippy --recent          # Grabs the file you just downloaded

# Interactive picker for recent files
clippy --recent --pick   # Choose from multiple recent downloads

# Pipe data as files
curl -sL https://picsum.photos/300 | clippy  # Download â†’ clipboard as file
```

Stay in your terminal. Copy anything. Paste anywhere.
