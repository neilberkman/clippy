# Changelog

Notable changes to clippy.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- buffer_cut tool for atomic cut operations (copy to buffer + delete from source)
- MCP server installation instructions in --help output

### Changed

- Optimized MCP tool descriptions for token efficiency
- README reorganized to promote MCP server section

## [1.5.1] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed

- Updated server.json tool descriptions to accurately reflect byte-level file manipulation
- Clarified buffer tool parameters and modes for better LLM understanding

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-09

### Added

- **BREAKING**: Complete rewrite of agent buffer tools for true byte-level copy/paste
  - `buffer_copy` - Copy file bytes (line ranges supported) to agent's private buffer
  - `buffer_paste` - Paste bytes to file with append/insert/replace modes
  - `buffer_list` - Show buffer metadata (lines, source file, range)
  - **Key improvement**: MCP server reads/writes file bytes directly - agent never generates tokens for copied content
  - Solves the LLM "remember and re-emit" problem with actual file manipulation, not token generation
  - Enables surgical refactoring: copy lines 17-32, paste to replace lines 5-8, etc.
  - No system clipboard interference

### Breaking Changes

- `buffer_copy` now requires `file` parameter (no longer accepts `text`)
- `buffer_paste` now requires `file` and `mode` parameters
- Buffer stores raw bytes, not text strings

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-09

### Deprecated

- Initial agent buffer tools (replaced in 1.5.0 with file-based byte manipulation)

## [1.3.4] - 2025-09-22

### Enhanced

- Improved MCP server tool descriptions to advertise the efficient `force_text` pattern
  - Added PRO TIPS explaining how to use temp files with `force_text='true'` for iterative editing
  - Helps LLMs discover this pattern for more efficient code editing workflows
  - Particularly useful for production debugging scenarios

## [0.8.0] - 2025-01-18

### Added

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server**: New `mcp-server` subcommand enables AI assistants to use clippy
  - Integrate with Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible AI tool
  - Three powerful tools exposed:
    - `clipboard_copy`: Copy text or files to clipboard programmatically
    - `clipboard_paste`: Paste clipboard content to files/directories
    - `get_recent_downloads`: List and work with recently downloaded files
  - Built with github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go for standard MCP compliance
  - Includes pre-built prompts for common operations
  - Simple setup: just add to claude_desktop_config.json
- **New `-i` flag for interactive picker**: Clean separation between immediate copy (`-r`) and interactive mode (`-i`)
  - `clippy -i` - show interactive picker with recent files
  - `clippy -i 3` - show picker with 3 most recent files
  - `clippy -i 5m` - show picker for files from last 5 minutes
  - Both `-r` and `-i` accept the same arguments (DRY implementation)
- **Lowercase 'p' key in picker**: Changed from 'P' to 'p' for copy & paste mode (easier to type)
- **Text paste to directories**: Pasting text content to a directory now creates timestamped .txt files

### Changed

- **Major architectural refactor**: Following Saša Jurić's Core vs Interface philosophy
  - Moved Bubble Tea picker from `pkg/recent/` to `cmd/clippy/`
  - Core library (pkg/) now only provides data and business logic
  - Interface elements (UI/TUI) live in cmd/ where they belong
  - This creates proper separation of concerns
- **Simplified `-r` flag behavior**: Now always does immediate copy (no picker)
  - `clippy -r` - copies most recent download immediately
  - `clippy -r 3` - copies 3 most recent downloads immediately
  - Use `-i` flag for interactive picker mode
- **Bubble Tea picker improvements**: Now supports both single and multi-select seamlessly
  - Space to toggle selection
  - Enter to copy (selected items or current item if nothing selected)
  - 'p' to copy & paste in one operation

### Fixed

- **Clipboard synchronization bug**: Fixed "Heisenbug" where clipboard operations only worked with --debug flag
  - Replaced hacky sleep with proper NSPasteboard changeCount polling
  - Clipboard operations now wait for macOS to confirm completion
  - Uses NSRunLoop to properly handle asynchronous pasteboard operations
  - This is the correct way to handle clipboard operations in macOS CLI tools
- **MCP tool naming**: Fixed validation error by changing tool names from forward slashes to underscores
- **Directories in picker**: Fixed issue where directories appeared in the file picker

### Removed

- **Removed --batch flag**: Functionality integrated into numbered copies (e.g., `clippy -r 3`)
- **Removed --pick flag**: Use `-i` for interactive picker instead
- **Removed picker from pkg/recent**: UI components now properly live in cmd/

## [0.7.2] - 2025-07-17

### Changed

- **Major architectural refactor**: Moved all recent downloads functionality from pasty to clippy
  - Recent downloads is about file selection, which belongs in clippy (copy TO clipboard)
  - Pasty now focuses purely on pasting FROM clipboard
  - This creates cleaner separation of concerns
- **New `--paste` flag in clippy**: Copy and paste in one step
  - `clippy file.txt --paste` - copy to clipboard AND paste to current directory
  - `clippy -r --paste` - copy recent download and paste here
  - `clippy -r --pick --paste` - pick file, copy it, and paste here

### Fixed

- **Picker functionality**: Fixed `--pick` flag that was broken in v0.7.1 due to buggy wrapper function
- **DRY refactor**: Removed `PastePickedRecentDownload()` wrapper, both tools now use shared `PickRecentDownload()` function
- **Public API**: Made `CopyFileToDestination()` public for shared use between tools
- **Test fixes**: Fixed hardcoded test expectations and handling of filenames with spaces

### Removed

- **Recent downloads in pasty**: All `-r/--recent` functionality removed from pasty
  - Use `clippy -r --paste` instead of `pasty -r`
  - This is a breaking change but creates better architecture

## [0.7.1] - 2025-07-17

### Changed

- **Streamlined recent downloads UX**: `-r/--recent` now accepts optional time duration directly
  - `clippy -r 5m` instead of `clippy --recent --recent-time 5m`
  - `pasty -r 1h` instead of `pasty --recent --recent-time 1h`
  - Backward compatibility maintained with `--recent` long form
- **Updated documentation**: All examples now show the streamlined `-r` usage pattern

## [0.7.0] - 2025-07-17

### Added

- **Recent downloads functionality**: Copy your most recent downloads without leaving the terminal
  - `clippy -r` / `pasty -r` - copy most recent download
  - `clippy -r 5m` / `pasty -r 5m` - time-based filtering
  - `clippy -r --batch` / `pasty -r --batch` - copy all files from recent batch download
  - `clippy -r --pick` / `pasty -r --pick` - interactive picker using promptui
- **Smart Downloads folder detection**: Automatically finds and scans macOS Downloads folder
- **Batch download handling**: Groups files downloaded within 30 seconds for batch operations
- **Archive auto-detection**: Smart handling of common archive types (.zip, .tar.gz, .dmg, etc.)
- **Separate debug and verbose modes**: `--debug` for technical details, `--verbose` for user-friendly output
- **Enhanced logging**: Debug mode shows technical details while verbose shows user-friendly messages

### Technical

- **Cobra CLI framework**: Professional command-line interface with comprehensive help
- **Library-first architecture**: All functionality available as Go library functions
- **Platform-specific build constraints**: Proper macOS-only compilation

## [0.6.1] - 2025-07-17

### Fixed

- Pasty now correctly prioritizes file references over text content when both are present on clipboard
- When you copy a file from Finder, pasty now outputs the file path instead of just the filename

### Changed

- Pasty now defaults to copying files to current directory when no destination is specified (equivalent to `pasty .`)

## [0.6.0] - 2025-07-16

### Added

- **UTI detection**: Hybrid detection system using macOS UTI → MIME → mimetype fallback for maximum reliability
- **Enhanced verbose output**: Shows which detection method was used (UTI, MIME, or content analysis)
- **CI for pull requests**: GitHub Actions workflow runs tests, linting, and builds on all PRs
- **Pasty library architecture**: Refactored to use `clippy.PasteToStdout()` and `clippy.PasteToFile()` functions

### Changed

- More accurate type detection using macOS's native UTI system instead of relying solely on MIME types
- Pasty now uses library functions for DRY architecture (thin CLI over rich library functionality)
